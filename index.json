	"content": "Create RSA Certificate Steps to create RSA Certificate With mutual authentication, Client VPN uses certificates to perform authentication between the client and the server. Certificates are a digital form of identification issued by a certificate authority (CA). The server uses client certificates to authenticate clients when they attempt to connect to the Client VPN endpoint. You must create a server certificate and key, and at least one client certificate and key.\nYou must upload the server certificate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and specify it when you create a Client VPN endpoint. When you upload the server certificate to ACM, you also specify the certificate authority (CA). You only need to upload the client certificate to ACM when the CA of the client certificate is different from the CA of the server certificate.\nYou can create a separate client certificate and key for each client that will connect to the Client VPN endpoint. This enables you to revoke a specific client certificate if a user leaves your organization. In this case, when you create the Client VPN endpoint, you can specify the server certificate ARN for the client certificate, provided that the client certificate has been issued by the same CA as the server certificate.traffic.\nThe following procedure installs Easy-RSA 3.x. software and uses it to generate server and client certificates and keys.\nTo generate server and client certificates and keys and upload them to ACM\nOpen the EasyRSA releases page and download the ZIP file for your version of Windows and extract it.\nOpen a PowerShell and navigate to the location that the EasyRSA-3.x folder was extracted to.\nRun the following command to open the EasyRSA 3 shell. .\\EasyRSA-Start.bat\nInitialize a new PKI environment ./easyrsa init-pki To build a new certificate authority (CA), run this command ./easyrsa build-ca nopass and follow the prompts. For \u0026ldquo;Common Name\u0026rdquo; enter awsclientvpnworkshop.com Generate the server certificate and key ./easyrsa build-server-full awsclientvpnworkshop.com nopass Type yes to confirm when prompted Generate the server certificate and key ./easyrsa build-client-full user1.awsclientvpnworkshop.com nopass Type yes to confirm when prompted Exit the EasyRSA 3 shell.

With client VPN, you can access your resources from any location using an OpenVPN-based VPN client.\nAWS Client VPN use cases\nQuickly scale remote access - Unexpected events can require many of your employees to work remotely. This creates a spike in VPN connections and traffic that can reduce performance or availability for your users. AWS Client VPN is elastic, and automatically scales up to handle peak demand. When the spike has passed, it scales down so you are not paying for unused capacity.\nAccess applications during migration - AWS Client VPN provides users with secure access to applications both on premises and in AWS. This is helpful during a cloud migration when applications move from on-premises locations to the cloud. With AWS Client VPN, users don’t have to change the way they access their applications during or after migration.\nIntegrate with your authentication and MDM systems - AWS Client VPN supports authentication with Microsoft Active Directory using AWS Directory Services, Certificate-based authentication, and Federated Authentication using SAML-2.0 to facilitate these scenarios when using the AWS provided OpenVPN Client software. AWS Client VPN works with Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to reject devices that do not comply with the your policies.\nSecurely connecting IoT devices - Create encrypted connections between IoT devices and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources using certificate-based authentication.\nIn this lab, you will create AWS Client VPN connect to EC2 Private on VPC.
